# hello-world
I'm doing this for the first time. I hope it goes well. I need help with Visual Studio. I'm taking the course Intro to Programming using Python.
I'm a retired veteran and I started coding a few years ago. I got frustrated and stopped but in my heart I knew I wanted to code. So here I am back at it.
